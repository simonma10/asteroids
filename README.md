# asteroids
Classic Asteroids game, built with kontra.js

I started this project to learn [kontra.js](https://straker.github.io/kontra/), and began with the [excellent tutorial from Steven Lambert](https://medium.com/web-maker/making-asteroids-with-kontra-js-and-web-maker-95559d39b45f).

Originally this arcade game was celebrated for its crisp vector graphics. Reproducing that look and feel was made easier with the [Vector Battle font](https://www.fontspace.com/freaky-fonts/vector-battle), which provides characters for asteroids, saucers and ships.
